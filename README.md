# Portfolio Page

Simple portfolio page created with Svelte 5 and Svelte Kit which uses dynamic routing and page creating creation

## Functionality

Project pages are automatically rendered using a dynamic layout template, which enables efficient and consistent display. A modular structure allows content to be flexibly integrated and adapted.

Currently, content is sourced from a JSON file, with the aim of switching to a headless CMS such as Strapi in the future to make content management even easier.

## Setup

The website is divided into two main areas: (app) and (entry). While (entry) offers a unique layout, (app) uses a global grid layout consisting of header, main, and footer to ensure consistent user guidance.
